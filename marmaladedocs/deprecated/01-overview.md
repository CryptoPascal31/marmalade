# Deprecation

As we strive to improve Marmalade, it's natural that certain features are refined, replaced, or even retired to make way for new, more efficient ones. We understand that change isn't always straightforward, especially when you're used to specific ways of doing things. But worry not, we're here to provide all the necessary information and guide you through this process.

As part of our commitment to transparency and our users' ease of use, we will compile comprehensive lists of deprecated functions (if any). Each entry in this list provides an overview of what the function used to do before deprecation, the reason for its deprecation, and, most importantly, the alternative methods or functions introduced, if any that you can use instead.

The objective here is not only to ensure you're aware of these changes, but also to help you understand why we made these decisions and how you can adapt to them. After all, every modification we've made is aimed at improving Marmalade's functionality and better serving our community's needs.
