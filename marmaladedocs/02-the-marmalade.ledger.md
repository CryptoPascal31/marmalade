 # The Marmalade Ledger Explained

 ## What is the Marmalade Ledger?

 What is it and what is it used for. Think of a ledger as your personal bank statement, only in this case its not just for you, it's for everybody participating in the system. It's this big ol' record that keeps track of the things within marmalade that happen. You can look at the ledger as the heart of marmalade, the place where most of the action happens.

In the context of NFTs, the Marmalade Ledger plays a crucial role in managing the lifecycle of these unique digital assets. It provides the underlying infrastructure and framework necessary to create, transfer, and track ownership of NFTs within the Marmalade ecosystem. It acts as a decentralised, transparent, and immutable ledger of ownership, ensuring that every change in ownership, creation, or transfer of an NFT is securely and accurately recorded.

The ledger consists of several components. It defines tables and schemas to organise data related to accounts and tokens. It includes capabilities, which are functions that perform specific actions and enforce certain conditions. By leveraging the capabilities, tables, and schemas defined within the ledger, developers and users can interact with NFTs in a standardised and reliable manner. The ledger enforces policies and guards to ensure compliance with predefined rules and constraints, promoting secure and trustworthy NFT transactions.


## Diving Deeper into the Marmalade Ledger

When delving further into the ledger's workings, we find each function and capability playing a unique role in its operation and management.

### Capabilities

There are capabilities like `TRANSFER` and `XTRANSFER`, which work similarly to the transfer feature on your online banking application. They help move tokens between accounts. There are also capabilities for updates and checks, such as `SUPPLY`, `TOKEN`, `ACCOUNT_GUARD`, and `RECONCILE`.

Some more specific capabilities include `ADJUST_POLICY`, which allows changes to token-associated policies, and `ROTATE` which permits a change in the guard of an account. `DEBIT` and `CREDIT` give the power to use debit or credit functions, and `UPDATE_SUPPLY` allows adjustments to a token's total circulation.

Capabilities like `MINT` and `BURN` enable creation and removal of tokens respectively. Lastly, `LEDGER` provides a security check, ensuring executed policies have correct permissions.

### Marketplace related capabilities

Special marketplace-related capabilities like `SALE`, `OFFER`, `WITHDRAW`, and `BUY` facilitate the trading of tokens within the marketplace.


### Core functions
 
Core functions such as `create-token`, `create-account`, `mint`, `burn`, `offer`, `withdraw`, `buy`, `transfer`, `get-balance`, `details`, `rotate`, `total-supply`, `get-uri`, and `adjust-policy` offer a variety of operations from creating new tokens and accounts to managing token trading in the marketplace.

  

### Internal / Helper functions

Helper functions like `precision`, `enforce-unit`, `debit`, `credit`, `get-token-info`, `TRANSFER-mgr`, `account-guard`, `ledger-guard`, `enforce-token-reserved`, `truncate`, `enforce-transfer-policy`, `credit-account`, `update-supply`, `key`, `sale-active`, `sale-account`, and `transfer-crosschain` provide support to the core functions and capabilities.
