# Marmalade v2 metadata standard

The Marmalade v2 metadata standard, serves as a crucial component for constructing a comprehensive and comprehensible profile for each NFT.
Now, it may seem a little intimidating at first glance, but when you break it down, it's really a guide to how we describe the unique features of each Non-Fungible Token (NFT) on the Marmalade platform.

This schema provides the structural foundation for key attributes of an NFT, each representing an integral facet of the NFT's identity. 
However, the schema also allows for the addition of arbitrary properties that serve to enhance the individuality of each token.

## Json standard

A significant characteristic of marmalade involves the URI attribute, a pointer to an off-chain JSON file. This design ensures the delivery of usefull information on tokens without straining the constraints imposed by on-chain data storage fees.

The off-chain schema contains properties that describe the metadata of an NFT stored off-chain in a JSON format. The schema includes the following fields:

| **Field Name**  |  **Data Type**   |                                                                                                                           **Description**                                                                                                                           |

Values may be strings, numbers, object or arrays.                                                                                               |
| \*authors       | array of objects |                                                               An array of authors who created or contributed to the asset.

| \*external_url  |      string      |                                                                                            URL to an external application or website where users can also view the asset                                                                                            |
| \*animation_url |      string      | URL to a multimedia attachment of the asset. The supported file formats are MP4 and MOV for video, MP3, FLAC and WAV for audio, GLB for AR/3D assets, and HTML for HTML pages. You may use the ?ext={file_extension} query to provide information on the file type. |
| \*collection    |      object      |                                                 an object with a "name" field specifying the name of the collection, and a “family” field specifying the larger category or group to which the collection belongs.                                                  |

The Marmalade v2 metadata standard for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) adheres closely to the widely recognised ERC1155 metadata standard. By aligning with this well-established standard, Marmalade enables seamless portability and interoperability of NFTs between the Ethereum network and the Kadena blockchain.

Both standards share similar fundamental attributes for describing NFTs.
Marmalade v2 also supports additional optional fields, including "properties," which allow for the inclusion of arbitrary properties to enhance the uniqueness and individuality of each token. Similarly, the ERC1155 metadata standard includes the "properties" field, ensuring compatibility between the two standards in terms of extensibility.

Another addittion to Marmalade v2 is the inclusion of the "authors" field, which enables the attribution of the individuals who created or contributed to the asset. This promotes transparency and recognition of the artistic and creative contributions associated with each NFT.

Marmalade v2 recognises the importance of categorisation and collection organization. The "collection" field in Marmalade v2, allows for specifying the name and family of the collection to which the NFT belongs. This categorisation provides context and grouping, facilitating efficient management and discovery of NFTs within a broader ecosystem.

In summary, Marmalade's adoption of the ERC1155 metadata standard showcases a dedication to following established industry norms, ensuring consistency, compatibility, and ease of migration for NFTs. This commitment enables a broader range of users to participate in the vibrant world of digital collectibles while fostering interoperability between different blockchain ecosystems.
